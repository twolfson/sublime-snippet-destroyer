# sublime-snippet-destroyer

Destroy all [Sublime Text][] completions and snippets.

[Sublime Text]: http://sublimetext.com/

This was created out of frustration while using `Tab`. `sublime-snippet-destroyer` does not aim to allow for restoration of snippets. If we started doing that, then we should make a full-fledged snippet manager.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install sublime-snippet-destroyer`

```javascript
var sublime_snippet_destroyer = require('sublime-snippet-destroyer');
sublime_snippet_destroyer.awesome(); // "awesome"
```
