# sublime-hooks

Run Sublime commands on common event hooks (e.g. `on_new`, `on_post_save`).

This was designed to give event level bindings to other Sublime plugins.

My use case was to make a [request][] (via [sublime-request][request] to a server when a save occurs. The result was:

```json
"on_post_save_user": [
  {
    "command": "request",
    "args": {
      "open_args": ["http://localhost:7060/"]
    },
    "scope": "window"
  }
]
```

## Getting started
### Creating a new hook
For this exercise, we will be creating a binding that selects all text after a save occurs.

A hook can be added at the `User`, `Project`, or `Language` level. We will add a `User` level hook.

To edit `User` settings, open the command pallete, and select "Preferences: Settings - User".

In the opened preferences, create a new key/value pair for `on_post_save_user` with the following:

```json
"on_post_save_user": [
  {
    "command": "select_all"
  }
]
```

Then, save twice (once to save settings, another to trigger the plugin).

At this step, all text will be selected, demonstrating the hook and command were run.

## Documentation
Hooks are stored in the `User`, `Project`, or `Language` settings. Each of these expects a list of dictionaries. Each of those dictionaries satisfies the following:

- `command` (required), Command for Sublime to run via `run_command` at the listed `scope`.
- `args` (optional), Dictionary of arguments to be passed to . Comparable to `args` in "Key Bindings".
- `scope` (optional), String indicating where to run `command`. By default, commands are run in the `view`. Other options are `window` and `app` which run at the `window` and `sublime` levels respectively.

```js
"on_post_save_user": [
  {
    // Runs `request` command
    "command": "request",

    // Invokes `request` with `open_args=["http://...:7060/"]`
    "args": {
      "open_args": ["http://localhost:7060/"]
    },

    // Runs `request` via `window.run_command`
    "scope": "window"
  }
]
```

### Accessing settings
`User` settings are accessed via "Preferences: Settings - User" in the command pallete.

`Project` settings are accessed via "Project -> Edit Project" from the menu bar. **You must be in a saved project for this option to be accessible.**

`Language` settings are accessed via "Preferences -> Settings - More -> Syntax Specific - User". This will open settings specifically for the language in the open file.

### Namespacing
Hooks are required to be namespaced at the `User`, `Project`, or `Language` level. The key will be the `event_name` followed by its `_level`.

The namespaces are `_user`, `_project`, and `_language`.

For demonstration:

- An `on_new` hook at the `Project` level will be `on_new_project`
- An `on_load` at the `Language` level will be `on_load_language`

### Events
For both Sublime Text 2 and 3, you will have access to the following events:

- `on_new`
- `on_clone`
- `on_load`
- `on_close`
- `on_pre_save`
- `on_post_save`
- `on_activated`
- `on_deactivated`

For Sublime Text 3, you gain access to:

- `on_new_async`
- `on_clone_async`
- `on_load_async`
- `on_pre_close`
- `on_pre_save_async`
- `on_post_save_async`
- `on_activated_async`
- `on_deactivated_async`

Documentation on each hook can be found in the Sublime Text documentation:

Sublime Text 2 - http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/api_reference.html#sublime_plugin.EventListener

Sublime Text 3 - http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html#sublime_plugin.EventListener

The events not on these lists were excluded due to potential performance issues (e.g. `on_modified`, `on_text_command`).
